# React Basics – Input and Greeting Example

This simple React project demonstrates the use of **state**, **event handling**, and **component rendering** in React without using a build system (like Vite or Create React App).  
It uses **CDN links** for React, ReactDOM, and Babel so it can run directly in the browser with a single HTML file.

## 📋 Project Description

The project includes a small interactive React component that:

- Displays an input field for typing a name.
- Updates the greeting message (`Hello [name]`) in real-time as you type.
- Includes two buttons:
  - **Reset**: Clears the input.
  - **Example**: Automatically fills in “Ayoub” as an example name.

This demonstrates the core concepts of React such as **state management (`useState`)**, **event listeners (`onChange`, `onClick`)**, and **component rendering**.
